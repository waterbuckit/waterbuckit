### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ğŸ¦†

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on formine.js, a Preact-based, JSON-schema'd form renderer, feel free to check out the development branch at https://github.com/waterbuckit/formine.js/tree/develop and have a play, hoping to eventually extend into a SaaS platform.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Svelte!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about PHP, Laravel, AlpineJS and Livewire, I spend my life working with them at my day job.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love ducks.
