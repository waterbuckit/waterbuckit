### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦†

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on formine.js, a Preact-based, JSON-encoded(schema) form renderer to make managing the swathes of complex forms chock full of conditional logic you often find in a system easier to manage and deploy with full customisability. Feel free to check out the development branch at https://github.com/waterbuckit/formine.js/tree/develop and have a play, hoping to eventually extend into a SaaS platform.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PHP, Laravel, Alpine.js and Livewire, I spend my life working with them at my day job.
